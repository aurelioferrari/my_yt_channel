In order to figure out what kind of video I should continue making for my channel, I decided to check which one is more profitable.</p>

First of all, I wanted to check the contribution in views and earnings of 3 main series in the channel. (Mario Kart, God of War and Resident Evil)

`Observation 1` - Resident Evil is the biggest series in both metrics.</p>
`Observation 2` - However, Mario Kart videos are really short to record and provide almost the same earnings as the other 2 series.</p>

Observation 2 is seen on the 3rd graphic where the amount of hours watched of each series is compared, with Mario Kart being less than 20% of watch time.

`Observation 3` - The video with most views, however, is from God of War.</p>
`Observation 4` - The other 4 places that follow belong to Resident Evil Series.</p>

`Observation 5` - God of War has the top 3 numers of impressions. That means Youtube recommends them more than others and/or the SEO is better on those videos.</p>
`Observation 6` - Even in 3rd place in views, the number of impressions for Mario Kart is bigger than in Resident Evil Series.</p>

`Observation 7` - The biggest click % is on a tutorial video for a Resident Evil game.</p>
`Observation 8` - The 3rd place is a review from a Resident Evil game.</p>

Conclusion:
Mario Kart videos are shorter and easier to record. However, % of clicks on impressions might be too low which means the thumbnails and titles have to be improved.</p>
However, the biggest impressions are for God of War and Mario Kart.
I'll get more data for Mario Kart series and then compare for the last 90 days and check if the discrepancy is bigger.
